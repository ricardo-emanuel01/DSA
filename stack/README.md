# Stacks

A stack is a fundamental abstract data type that can be implemented using various underlying data structures, such as a circular static array, a dynamic array, a singly linked list, or a doubly linked list. Stacks are characterized by three primary operations: **push**, **pop**, and **peek**. These operations allow for the manipulation and retrieval of elements within the stack. The analogy of a stack of plates in a kitchen provides a useful mental model to understand how stacks operate: just as we add plates to the top of the stack and retrieve the topmost plate, a stack follows a similar Last-In-First-Out (**LIFO**) principle.

## Stack Operations:

- **Push**: This operation involves adding an element to the top of the stack. It effectively extends the stack's height. The newly added element becomes the topmost element.

- **Pop**: The pop operation removes the top element of the stack. As a result, the stack's height is reduced, and the element below the removed one becomes the new top.

- **Peek**: Peek, also known as top or topmost operation, allows us to view the top element of the stack without removing it. This provides insight into the current state of the stack.

## Applications of Stacks:

Stacks find versatile applications across various domains, contributing to the efficiency and organization of processes:

- **Memory Management**: In programming, stacks are instrumental in managing memory. They enable the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks in a systematic manner, facilitating efficient use of available memory resources.

- **Function Calls**: Stacks play a pivotal role in managing the execution of functions within a program. When a function is called, its local variables and return address are pushed onto the stack. Once the function completes, these elements are popped, allowing the program to resume its execution.

- **Operating Systems**: Stacks aid operating systems in managing tasks and processes. Each task's execution context, including information such as program counters and register values, can be stored and retrieved using stacks.


In summary, stacks offer a structured approach to managing data and operations by adhering to the LIFO principle. Their versatility and efficient operations make them essential components in memory management, function calls, and operating system tasks. By grasping the concepts and applications of stacks, you gain a fundamental understanding of how data can be organized and manipulated systematically.
