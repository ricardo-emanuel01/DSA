# Queue

A queue is a fundamental data structure commonly used in computer science and programming. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Just like people waiting in a line (queue) at a grocery store, the element that arrives first is served first.  
Queues are akin to a real-life line or queue and are useful in scenarios where order matters. They are often used in situations like managing tasks that need to be processed in the order they were received.  
The main operations on a queue are **enqueue** and **dequeue**. Enqueue adds an element to the back of the queue, while dequeue removes the front element. This ensures that the oldest element is processed before newer elements.  
Queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays or linked lists.  
Additionally, there are variations of queues, such as **priority queues**, where elements are assigned priorities and removed in order of their priority rather than their arrival time.  
In summary, queues are an essential concept in computer science that models scenarios where elements need to be processed in a specific order.
